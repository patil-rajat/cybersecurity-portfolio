    "## Scenario \n",
    "Youâ€™re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of PASTA\n",
