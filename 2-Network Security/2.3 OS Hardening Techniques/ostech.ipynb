    "## Scenario\n",
    "You are a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A former employee has decided to lure users to a fake website with malware. \n",
    "\n",
    "The former employee/ hacker executed a brute force attack to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the administrative account until they correctly guessed the right one. After they obtained the login credentials, they were able to access the admin panel and change the website’s source code. They embedded a javascript function in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After embedding the malware, the hacker changed the password to the administrative account. When customers download the file, they are redirected to a fake version of the website that contains the malware. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk. They complained that the company’s website had prompted them to download a file to access free recipes. The customers claimed that, after running the file, the address of the website changed and their personal computers began running more slowly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In response to this incident, the website owner tries to log in to the admin panel but is unable to, so they reach out to the website hosting provider. You and other cybersecurity analysts are tasked with investigating this security event.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the incident, you create a sandbox environment to observe the suspicious website behavior. You run the network protocol analyzer tcpdump, then type in the URL for the website, yummyrecipesforme.com. As soon as the website loads, you are prompted to download an executable file to update your browser. You accept the download and allow the file to run. You then observe that your browser redirects you to a different URL, greatrecipesforme.com, which contains the malware.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The logs show the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The browser initiates a DNS request: It requests the IP address of the yummyrecipesforme.com URL from the DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. The DNS replies with the correct IP address. \n",
    "\n",
    "    4. The browser initiates an HTTP request: It requests the yummyrecipesforme.com webpage using the IP address sent by the DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. The browser initiates the download of the malware.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. The browser initiates a DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. The DNS server responds with the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "    8. The browser initiates an HTTP request to the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "A senior analyst confirms that the website was compromised. The analyst checks the source code for the website. They notice that javascript code had been added to prompt website visitors to download an executable file. Analysis of the downloaded file found a script that redirects the visitors’ browsers from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cybersecurity team reports that the web server was impacted by a brute force attack. The disgruntled hacker was able to guess the password easily because the admin password was still set to the default password. Additionally, there were no controls in place to prevent a brute force attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to document the incident in detail, including identifying the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website.  You should also recommend a security action to take to prevent brute force attacks in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The TCPdump traffic log is in the PDF 'tcpdump traffic log'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Incident Report\n",
    "> Access the 'Security Incident Report' template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmTZQGiYdJSgwQ08IpXWEUWhnKMVbJ2KZxsheZhzMMs/template/preview).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part-1: Identifying the network protocol involved in the accident\n",
    "The HTTP protocol is impacted in this scenario, port 80 is commonly associated with the 'http' protocol. TCPdump detected the issue and captured the traffic activity in the DNS and HTTP traffic log. Because the malicious file is being sent to the users, this attack is occuring at the application layer of the TCP/IP model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part-2: Documenting the incident\n",
    "Customers reported that when they visited the original site (yummyrecipesforme.com), they were prompted to download a file to access free recipes. They also complained that the original site changed after the download and computers ran slowly. The security team tested the website in a sandbox. They collected the network traffic packets which were generated while browsing the site. After successfully downloading the file, they noticed the fake website (greatreceipesforme.com) had name similar to original site. The security team also discovered that the administrator account was compromised.\n",
    "Based on the network logs, the browser requested the IP address for yummyreceipesforme.com. Once the connection was established over the HTTP protocol, the prompt was made by the site to the security team for downloading and executing the file. After this the logs showed a sudden change in network traffic as the malicious file sent the users to new destination (greatreceipesforme.com), hence new IP was logged.\n",
    "The senior analyst inspected the source code and discovered that the attacker had modified it to prompt users to download a malicious file which promised them free recipes. Since, the administrator was locked out of access, it was accessed brute force attack was used by attacker. The execution of the file compromised the user's computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part-3: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks\n",
    "For preventing brute force attacks in the the future, the organisation could enforce the 2-Factor Authorisation (2FA). Enforcing 2FA adds an additional layer of security beyond traditional password authentication. With 2FA, even if an attacker successfully guesses or compromises password, they cannot gain access without the secondary authentication factor, such as a time-sensitive code (OTP), biometric verification, or a physical security token. 2FA is highly effective because of the following reasons: <br>\n",
    "* It mitigates the risks associated with weak or reused passwords. <br>\n",
    "* It ensures that only authorized users with access to the second factor can log in. <br>\n",
    "* It acts as a deterrent to attackers, as brute force attacks are significantly less effective when multiple factors are utilised.\n"
